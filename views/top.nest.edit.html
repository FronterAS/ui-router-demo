<input value="Editing main view" />
<p>You probably had to wait for this view to render. Check out the 'resolve' in the 'edit' state. If you click 'Go to nest' and then click 'Edit nest' again, you will see that the resolve is not run again. That injectable is now available to you almost as a constant.</p>
